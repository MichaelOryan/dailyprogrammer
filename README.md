Don't worry about short code for DP.

Write clean understandable code because honestly I just looked at the two I've already done with strings and boy do I feel dirty. 

I'd much rather look at and work on my attempt in fuzzy-archer which is a little over 100 lines long than the 34 lines of the DP program.
